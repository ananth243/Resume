            I have basic knowledge of most python operators and functions. What I mean is I can create classes, objects,
            variables and many more basic operations

            I am most comfortable with this language in comparison with java and C/C++.
            </br>
            I also have basic knowledge of django, a web apllication that is a python framework for developing servers.
            </br>
            I can interface django with SQL databases also so I have no problem with working with it if I were given the
            oppurtunity to do so.
            I am currently learning Flask also.

          <p class="common">
            I have extrememely basic knowledge of nodejs when it comes to deployment of servers.
            </br>
            The reason is I have worked more frequently with 3rd party packages such as express, the web deployment
            framework and morgan, a middleware. I use mongoose also for a database and ejs for a view engine. All of
            which
            node.js supports
            </br>
            I am even learning on how to interface Google/Facebook and various other social media accounts to my web
            applications like OAuth verification.
            </br>
            To do this I use a third party package called passport that id built for this purpose.
            </br>
            I participated in a Hackathon where we created KIranaRoom (still in development) where students inside large
            campuses can have room delivered products from various shops
            </br>
            Here is the <a href="https://www.github.com/ananth243/Hackathon" style="text-decoration: none;">link</a> if
            you
            want to
            check it out.
            </br>
            If I had to deploy a web server and html pages, I would definitely prefer express if I had the choice but I
            have no problem with other web server applications (based on python or javascript) such as Django, Flask etc

            I am familiar with React applications and have basic knowledge regarding the syntaxes and its working
            </br>
            As I work in more projects as I go along I expect that knowledge to develop and improve as I still have a
            lot
            left to learn

            I have enough knowledge in JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) content in web pages.
            </br>
            As I stated previously I am aware of its applications with regards to node.js, express and React
            </br>
            I am currently learning applications of Javascript such as vue.js.
            </br>
            After wrapping it up will move on to next.js and Typescript most probably.
